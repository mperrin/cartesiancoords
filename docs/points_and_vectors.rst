API Reference
===============

Note that the CoordVector and DisplacementVector classes are ultimately derived from numpy.matrix, 
so all the attributes and methods of any matrix are available for them.

.. autoclass:: cartesiancoords.CoordVector
   :members: toGlobal, toLocal, draw3d

.. autoclass:: cartesiancoords.DisplacementVector
